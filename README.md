IRC Parser
==========
This is a reentrant and asynchronous IRC parser written in C. It is capable of
parsing messages from IRC servers and clients. It is modeled after Ryan Dahl's
HTTP Parser library and was originally designed to be used with libuv for
RethinkIRCd.

Warning
-----
This library has not reached 1.0 and it's API is subject to dramatic change
until both it and RethinkIRCd mature.
